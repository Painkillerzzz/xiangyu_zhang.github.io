In recent years, with the rapid development of diffusion models, a variety of image generation and editing algorithms have emerged. One significant topic in this field is **controllable generation**. Within this area, a particularly artistic research problem is **style transfer**, which aims to apply the style of one image to another while preserving the content structure of the latter.

This project focuses on generating images in a specified style. Given a series of reference images sharing the same style, along with a designated prompt, we train models to guide the generation of images in the same style. 

Our approach requires separate weight fine-tuning for each style. For each style, 10 images are used for training. By inputting a prompt describing a new object, the model generates images of the object in the desired style.
