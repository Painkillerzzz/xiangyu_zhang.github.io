I am Xiangyu Zhang, an undergraduate student in the Class of 2026 at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently preparing to apply for a PhD program to further pursue my academic and research goals.

## News

 - 2026.01.15 - I'm currently visiting Berkeley as an exchange student!

## Research Interests

My current research interests focus on **multimodal models for reasoning and generation**. During my undergraduate studies, I have explored reasoning in large language models (LLMs) and post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning for math and coding. I have worked on multimodal editing tasks using flow matching-based models. I have also explored areas like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and human-computer interaction (HCI), particularly in the context of multimodal planning. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in both LLMs and multimodal AI, preparing me for further research in this field.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration or discussions related to my areas of interest!
