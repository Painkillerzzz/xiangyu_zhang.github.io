## Research Interests

My research interests focus on **NLP**. I am particularly interested in **enhancing reasoning abilities of LLM with Reinforcement Learning and tree-based methods**. During my undergraduate study, I have been exploring various areas of LLM studies, from understanding its inner workings to applying it to various tasks. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in the field of NLP and have prepared me for the challenges ahead.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration or discussions related to my areas of interest!
